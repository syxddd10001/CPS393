main calls a variable-argument function, foo. 
Function foo's first argument specifies the number and type of the 
optional arguments, which must be strings or ints, indicated by 
s and d respectively. foo prints each optional argument on its own
line, preceded by "string" or "int" appropriately.

main must be exactly:

int main (void) {
  foo("dsds",5,"some string",4,"another string");
}

The program produces this expected output: 
int: 5
string: some string
int: 4
string: another string
