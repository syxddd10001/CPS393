main must be:
int main (void) {
  char *S = newString("ABcd","efgHI");
  printf("Called newString with ABcd and efgHI\n");
  printf("It returned: %s\n", S);
  printf("with length: %ld\n", strlen(S));
  return 0;
}

newString returns a new string that contains a copy of str1 
followed by a copy of str2. Thus, program outputs:
Called newString with ABcd and efgHI
It returned: ABcdefgHI
with length: 9


Function newString MUST use malloc or calloc to allocate EXACTLY
the correct amount of storage to hold the new string, which is:
  (length of str1) + (length of str2) + (1 for '\0')
