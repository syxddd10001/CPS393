Answer file: ans8.c

Files que8.c and que8.h provide an abstraction for complex numbers.
File  que8M.c contains a main function that creates a complex
number and prints it.

Copy que8.c to ans8.c and replace XXXXXXX with code so the program 
produces output:
-4+7i

The abstraction for complex numbers is now in ans8.c and que8.h, so
your final program is compiled as follows: gcc que8M.c ans8.c

IMPORTANT: Replace only XXXXXXX in ans8.c; do not modify any other
parts of it, or this question's mark must be zero, since you won't
have answered the question asked. No special consideration will be
given. Final warning.
You can verify nothing else was modified by doing:
> diff que8.c ans8.c
