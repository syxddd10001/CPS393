Answer files: ans3[MDS].c

Files ans3[MDS].c compile to make one program; no other files 
may be involved (e.g., no .h files):
  ans3M.c contains the main function, as below
  ans3D.c contains function Double, as below
  ans3S.c contains function Square, as below

Obtain ans3[MDS].c by copying files que3[MDS].c respectively.
Modify ans3[MDS].c so that a variable x is SHARED by all 3 
files (global) as follows:
   ans3M.c ALLOCATES global x's storage and INITIALIZES it to 1.
   ans3D.c DOUBLES global x.
   ans3S.c SQUARES global x.

You may add lines of code to the 3 files, but you may NOT
delete/modify the (existing) lines copied from que[MDS].c
Hint: use extern

When x is thus shared, the program outputs:
x=10
