main reads 2 strings from stdin into X and Y, then calls function 
swap_string to swap strings X and Y WITHOUT moving their individual 
characters in memory. Assume X and Y have at at most 10 characters,
and contain no whitespace characters.

main must be:

int main (void) {
 char *X=malloc(11), *Y=malloc(11);
 scanf("%s %s",X,Y);
 printf("X:%s, ", X); printf("Y: %s\n", Y);
 swap_string(&X, &Y);
 printf("X:%s, ", X); printf("Y: %s\n", Y);
 return 0;
}

Example of running program:
> echo "abcdefgh 1234" | a.out
X:abcdefgh, Y: 1234
X:1234, Y: abcdefgh
