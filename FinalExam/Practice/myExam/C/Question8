Answer file: ans8.c

Given the answer file, fill in the XXXXX to answer the questions.
DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING ELSE IN THE CODE.

Files que8.c and que8.h provide an abstraction for complex numbers.
File  que8M.c contains a main function that creates a complex
number and prints it.

Copy que8.c to ans8.c and replace XXXXXXX with code so the program
produces output:
-4+7i

The abstraction for complex numbers is now in ans8.c and que8.h, so
your final program is compiled as follows: gcc que8M.c ans8.ci


Expected output:
-4+7i
