Answer file: ans15.sh

Program expects one command line argument, an integer from
1 to 12 inclusive, and prints the number of days in that month,
as follows: MMM has DD days
where MMM is the 3-letter abbreviated month name, and DD is the
number of days in that month. 

e.g.,
> ./ans15.sh 2
Feb has 28 days
> 
> ./ans15.sh 11
Nov has 30 days
> 

Program must define and appropriately use 2 functions: 

The first function takes one argument:
 It prints the 3-letter abbreviated month name for month number $1
 It must define and appropriately use this array containing the 
 3-letter abbreviated names:
 Month=(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec)

The second function takes one argument:
 It prints the number of days in month $1. 
 It must define and appropriately use this array containing the 
 number of days for each month:
 NumDays=(31 28 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31)

In the example output above, "Feb" and "Nov" were printed by
the first function, and "28" and "30" by the second function.
