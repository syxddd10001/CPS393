newString returns a new string that contains a copy of str1 followed by a copy of str2, str3, and str4.

Function newString MUST use malloc or calloc to allocate EXACTLY
the correct amount of storage to hold the new string, which is:
length of (str1 + str2 + str3 + str4) + 1 (+1 for /0)

Expected output:

It returned: ABcdefgHIjKLMnoPqRstu
with length: 21
