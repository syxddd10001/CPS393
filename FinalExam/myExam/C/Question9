Answer files: ans9[MNS].c


Files ans9[MNS].c compile to make one program; no other files
may be involved (e.g., no .h files):
  ans9M.c contains the main function, as below
  ans9N.c contains function MulN, as below
  ans9S.c contains function AddS, as below

Modify ans9[MNS].c so that variables x, s and n is SHARED by all 3
files (global) as follows:
    
    ans9M.c - main File 
    - ALLOCATES global variable x's storage and INITIALIZES it to 3.
    - shares the variable s from file ans9S.c
    - shares the variable n from file ans9N.c
   
    ans9S.c - modifies s by adding n and x  
    - ALLOCATES global variable s's storage and INITIALIZES it to 0.
    - shares the variable x from ans9M.c
    - shares the variable n from ans9N.c
   
    ans9N.c -  modifies n by multiplying x and s   
    - ALLOCATES global variable n's storage and INITIALIZES it to 1.
    - shares the variable x from ans9M.c
    - shares the variable s from ans9S.c 

ONLY CHANGE THE XXXXX and nothing else

Hint: use extern

When x, n and s is thus shared, the program outputs:
x=13
n=12
s=25
