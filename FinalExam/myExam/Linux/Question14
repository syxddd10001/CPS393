Answer file: ans14.sh

Program prints YES if lines $1 and $2 of file $3 are identical, and 
NO otherwise. Program MUST define and use a function that takes 2
arguments, and prints line $1 of file $2 on stdout.

e.g.,
> cat que14.in
line 1
line 2
line 3
line 4
line 5
line 2
line 7
> ./ans14.sh 2 3 que14.in
NO
> ./ans14.sh 2 6 que14.in
YES
> ./ans14.sh 2 2 que14.in
YES
