Program Ans5b takes one or more command line arguments, assumed to 
be positive integers. For each argument it prints on stdout HOW MANY 
prime factors it has.  Output must be exactly as below.

Ans5b MUST use: 
  -the factor command (to help find a number's prime factors)
  -the wc command (to help count how many prime factors a number has)

e.g.,
> Ans5b 23 1 18
23: 1 prime factors
1: 0 prime factors
18: 3 prime factors
