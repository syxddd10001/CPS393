Program Ans6 takes two command line arguments, assumed to be a
string containing no whitespace, and a readable file. 
Ans6 prints a count of the number of WORDS in the file that start 
with the given string.
Assume words on a line are separated by spaces.
Ans6 MUST use one or more loops to read words of the file.


e.g.,
> cat Ans6.infile
abcdef abc abcdog xyz
xycdef xyc xxy    art
mouse abcmouse Xymouse
>
> Ans6 abc Ans6.infile
4
> Ans6 xy Ans6.infile
