Given program arr2.sh is incomplete.  It is supposed to:
  -read an N*N binary matrix into array A
  -print the sum of entries on A's principal diagonal 
  -print the sum of entries on A's secondary diagonal
  -print A
where 
 -Principal diagonal runs top left to bottom right 
 -Secondary diagonal runs bottom left to top right 

COPY FILE arr.sh TO ans2.sh
MODIFY ans2.sh to complete function DiagSum. 
DiagSum requires one argument, expected to be "P" or "S". 
 -if "P" it prints the principal diagonal sum
 -if "S" it prints the secondary diagonal sum

An example of executing the completed program is:
> cat testfiles/q2.in1
4
1011
0001
1010
0101
> ans2.sh <testfiles/q2.in1
Principal diagonal sum=3
Secondary diagonal sum=1
Matrix A:
1011
0001
1010
0101
