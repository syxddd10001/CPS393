Write program ans5.sh, which sends only SOME lines of stdin to stdout. 
It determines which lines to send by prompting the user to respond 
y or n for each line of stdin. It MUST use xargs to prompt the user 
and output the appropriate line(s).

e.g.,
> cat testfiles/q5.in
line 1
line 2
line 3
line 4
line 5
line 6
> ./ans5.sh <testfiles/q5.in >q5.out
echo 'line 1' ?...y
echo 'line 2' ?...n
echo 'line 3' ?...n
echo 'line 4' ?...y
echo 'line 5' ?...n
echo 'line 6' ?...y
> cat q5.out
line 1
line 4
line 6
