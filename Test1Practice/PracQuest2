Program Ans2 uses bash commands to create the filetree below, 
where directory A2 is a subdirectory of your test home directory.

In the filetree, directories are shown with a trailing / (but / 
is not part of the name), and files are shown with no trailing /. 
File contents are not important (may be empty or not).
