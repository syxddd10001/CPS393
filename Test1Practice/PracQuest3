Program Ans3 uses a single chmod command to set permissions of 
all entries in directory D3 (from the filetree of PracQuest2) 
whose name contains at least one digit directly after a . (dot),
so that user (owner) is exactly rw-, group is exactly r--, and 
other is exactly --x. 

Your chmod command must specify the entries using an ABSOLUTE 
path name and apprpriate GLOB constructs.

Your chmod command must always work, even if entries in D3 
change later, for example to: abc def.77 x.y x.2y

Ans3 should NOT rely on the entries' starting permissions.
