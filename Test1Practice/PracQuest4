Program Ans4 uses one find command to list all the entries in the
filesystem that are DIRECTORIES, with names containing the character 
'D', starting at directory A2 from PracQuest2.
Remember, Ans4 is located in, and run from, your test home directory.

The find command should still work even if the contents of A2 change
later (still outputs all directories whose name contains a 'D'). 

Ans4 should produce exactly this output (line order may differ):
A2/D1
A2/D2
A2/D2/D4
A2/D3
