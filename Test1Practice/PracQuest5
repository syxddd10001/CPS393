Program Ans5 takes one or more command line arguments, assumed 
to be a positive integers. For each argument, it prints on stdout 
whether or not it is a prime number. Output must be exactly like the 
example.
Ans5 must use the factor command to help determine if the argument is
a prime number, by using the fact that a non-prime number has 2 or more
prime factors, but a prime has only 1 prime factor.


e.g.,
> Ans5 23 1 4
23 is PRIME
1 is NOT PRIME
4 is NOT PRIME
