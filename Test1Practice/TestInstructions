You will create 5 files in your test home directory:
   Ans1, Ans2, Ans3, Ans4, Ans5
Ans[2-5] are shell programs; ASSUME 
  -they are always executed from within your test home directory.
  -they reside in your test home directory (so does Ans1).

In Ans[2-5], include a bash comment line with your
Full Name, student ID, and CS username. 
e.g., Prof Woit would include this line:
#Denise Woit 999999999 dwoit
DO NOT PUT the comment in line 1 of a bash program!

For what to put in Ans[1-5] see question files PracQuest[1-5]

Answers are worth these marks:
Ans1: 0 marks but must be correct to get test graded
Ans2: 2 marks
Ans3: 3 marks
Ans4: 2 marks
Ans5: 3 marks

Although the test will have only 5 questions, more questions
are provided in this practice directory for more opportunity
to practice.
