Write a program named ans4.c that takes 1 command line argument, 
expected to be the name of a readable file. 
Your program prints the file in reverse order like the linux tac
command.  e.g.,
> cat f4
line 1
line 2
line 3
> tac f4
line 3
line 2
line 1
>

Your program (main function) must use this algorithm:
 1. call function fileSize to obtain, for the file named fname:
      -the length of the longest line in fname, and 
      -the number of lines in fname. 
    fileSize must open the file, and close it before returning.
    fileSize's protorype is:
    void fileSize (char *fname, int *longestLine, int *numLines ) ;

 2. allocate an array large enough so that each array row can hold 
    one line of the file.

 3. open the file, read each line into a row of the array, close the file.

 4. print rows of the array in reverse order, so that the program prints 
   the lines of the file in reverse order, like Linux tac.
