A program consists of these files:
   -listM.c         A main function, creates an empty list
   -listAddFront.c  function to add one item to front of list
   -listPrint.c     function to print list
   -list.h          definition of List
   -listAddFront.h  header for listAddFront
   -listPrint.h     header for listPrint

   The program creates a List, adds characters a-f to it, and then
   prints the resulting list.

(a) Compile and execute the program to verify its output is correct.
    In file ans6.txt, type the command you used to produce the 
    executable program. 

(b) Create ans6.c, containing the definition of function listRemoveRear 
    (prototype given in listRemoveRear.h) as follows:
    -REMOVE the LAST item from the given list and FREE its storage 
    -PASS the removed character back to main through the second argument
    -RETURN 0 if the list was already empty (no remove occurs), and 1 
     otherwise

Test your Function:
    -a main is provided in listMRR.c to help you test your function
    -compile listMRR.c with ans6.c 
    -compile listMRR.c with ans6.c and the other necessary files, and
     run it to test your listRemoveRear function. 

Expected output is: 

> ./a.out
List is:  e  d  c  b  a
removed a. List is now: e  d  c  b
removed b. List is now: e  d  c
removed c. List is now: e  d
removed d. List is now: e
removed e. List is now:
cannot remove from empty list
