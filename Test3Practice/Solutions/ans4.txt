(a) The quotes on "${i}*" pass a literal * to ls, so this asks ls 
    to list an entry literally named, say, 'a*' instead of entries
    whose name starts with a
(b) Fix 1. remove the quotes. 
    Fix 2. put eval before ls



Explanation (not required for your answers. Just FYI):

Fix 1. remove the quotes.
  With quotes removed, bash expands a* first to a list of all of entries 
  whose name starts with a, then passes those names to ls to list.
Fix 2. put eval before ls
  eval's first pass substitutes ${i}, giving: ls -d a*
  then eval would execute the resulting command, and bash would expand
  a* as above before sending the resulting list to ls.
