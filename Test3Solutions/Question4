The program below is supposed to solve this problem:
  Write a shell program that takes one or more command line arguments 
  (CLAs), which are each single characters. ASSUME correct arguments.
  For each CLA, program prints a line giving the number of entries
  in the current directory whose name starts with that character. 
  e.g.,
> ls
a abc art dog p p1 p2 p3 p35 petting zoo
> ./cn a r p d
a: 3 entries
r: 0 entries
p: 6 entries
d: 1 entries
>

#!/bin/bash
for i ; do
  echo -en "${i}: "
  echo $(ls -d "${i}*" 2>/dev/null | wc -l) entries
done
exit 0

The program does not work because of a problem with the ls line.
In a file named ans4.txt:
(a) Briefly and precisely explain the problem.
(b) Give two different ways you could fix this line.
