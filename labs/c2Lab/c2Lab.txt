Arrays, Pointers, Strings

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLES:

In the following questions, unless the question states otherwise,
assume correct input (format, etc. )

PROGRAM NAMES:

 c2Labq01.txt  Your answer to question 1. 
 c2Labq02.txt  Given. You copy and modify it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Program printArray.c is supposed to declare array A to have items 1 2 3 4 5 
   then print it.  However, when you run the program, it gives output similar to:
   3 4 5 32766 1806530560
   1.1 Explain why the output starts at 3
   1.2 Explain why the output ends with 2 strange numbers 
   1.3 Explain why these 2 strange numbers may change each time you rerun 
       the program.

2. Program c2Labq02.c reads a string, reverses it, and prints it. 
   Complete the program by replacing /*REPLACE THIS*/ with appropriate code. 
   The program must reverse the string IN PLACE place by swapping characters 
   of the string. Note that the program uses the readline library, which must 
   be explicitly linked, as in: gcc c2Labq02.c -lreadline
   Note the readline function prompts user, reads input, allocates proper 
   amount of storage for the input, and returns a pointer to that storage. 
   The pointer can be treated as a character array (holding a string), and
   accessed as usual, e.g., S[3] is the 4th character of the string.

   To determine the length of the returned string, use strlen(S).
   
   > ./c2Labq02  
         Enter a string: 12345678
      Entered string is: 12345678
     Reversed string is: 87654321
   >

3. Copy your c2Labq02.c to c2Labq02FUNC.c and modify the latter so that it
   reverses the string by sending it to a function named reverseString
   with prototype: void reverseString(char S[]); When the function returns
   the string in S is reversed.
