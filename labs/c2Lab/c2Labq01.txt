1.1 Because we have a pointer to the third element as the printit input.

1.2 They are garbage values. We are iterating LEN times which is 5, but we are starting at the 3rd position. So we are accessing memory which is not allocated to the array, because we allocated length 5, but we are going beyond that.

1.3 Because we are accessing part of the memory which is not allocated to the original array. That memory location is probably being used by another program or another part of the same program.
