Answers to question 5 in Part 1:

You can find the answers by doing "man ls" and then searching
n the man page for / 
Remember you search string "string" by typing /string
so in order to search for a / you need to do:
//
so that you search for a /
Then you can type n to get the next occurence (or // again)

Either of these to get color 
ls --color=auto   
ls --color

Either of these to get / appended to directories
ls -p  #the best one, since it ONLY appends / to directories
ls -F  #it appends / to dirs, but also other characters, e.g., 
       #appends * to executable files.
ls --file-type #is like -F except doesn't append any * characters
