Did these from within my cps393 directory:

chmod u=rw,g=x,o= labs/u1Lab/myInfo.txt 
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o= labs 

But there are many ways to set required permissions.
For example, 
  If the permissions on myInfo.txt were originally
    rwxrw---x then  could have done:
    chmod u-x,g-rw+x,o-x labs/u1Lab/myInfo.txt
  If I was already in dir u1Lab, then I could have specified
    the file by: myInfo.txt instead of labs/u1Lab/myInfo.txt

  Could have used numeric mode:
    chmod 610 labs/u1Lab/myInfo.txt
    chmod 750 labs
