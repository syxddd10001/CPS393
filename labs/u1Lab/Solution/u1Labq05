To create dir Inv in home dir:
> cd
> mkdir Inv

To create file F could use touch or cat or vim:
> cd Inv
> touch F      #creates empty file F
> #or
> cat "hi" >F  #creates file F containing this one line

To list entries in Inv and display contents of Inv/F, should
be able to do these with no error messages given:
> cd
> ls Inv
> cat Inv/F

Permissions needed for user are at least rx on Inv, and r on F
You can verify this by making perms 
dr-x------ for Inv 
-r-------- for F
Verify you get no error messages when doing these:
> cd
> ls Inv
> cat Inv/F

Then remove user's perms on Inv and F in various combinations and
see you get error messages when doing the ls and cat again.

As an added point, notice that if you try to delete Inv and/or F,
you will get error messages because you won't have permissions.
If you ever want to delete them, you will need to add some w perms.
