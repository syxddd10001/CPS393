You can use this sequence of commands to determine if first 3 lines of F
are identical to last 3 of L:

> head -3 F >F3     #first 3 lines of F into file F3
> tail -3 L >L3     #last  3 lines of L into file L3
> diff F3 L3        #prints nothing if F3 identical to L3
                    #prints differences if they differ

Note could also use -s option of diff
> diff -s F3 L3     #prints message if files identical and
                    #prints differences if they differ
