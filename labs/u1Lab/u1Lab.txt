CPS393 u1Lab:

   commands:  cd, cat, ls, pwd, cp, mkdir, mv, vim, chmod, touch

------------------------------------
 Part 1
------------------------------------

Done. 1. Move around directories, list entries in directories, and verify 
   current directory using:  cd, ls, pwd commands as follows:

   Move into your home directory:  cd
   Move into the course directory: cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/
   List the entries there:         ls
   Change into the labs directory  cd labs
   List the entries there:         ls
   Change into the first lab       cd u1Lab
   List the entries there:         ls

   Change back into your HOME directory:  cd
   Move back-and-forth between your home directory and the previous directory
   (/usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/u1Lab) by using the following command over and over:
   cd -
   Each time you change directories, verify you are in the correct directory by
   using the following command:
   pwd

Done 2. Use mkdir to create directories as follows:
   Move into your home directory:  cd
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Make directory cps393:          mkdir cps393
   Verify it was created:          ls
   Move into dir cps393:           cd cps393
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Make dir labs:                  mkdir labs
   Verify it was created:          ls
   Move into dir labs:             cd labs
   Make directories for the first 4 labs:
                                   mkdir vimLab u1Lab u2Lab u3Lab
   Verify they were created:       ls


Done 3. Use cp to copy file(s):
   When you did vimLab, you copied file vimTutorial.txt from /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/vimLab/
   to your home directory and modified it with vim.
   Move your own vimTutorial.txt file from your home directory into your vimLab directory:
   Move into your home dir:           cd
   Verify vimTutorial.txt is there:   ls  
     (If ls vimTutorial.txt isn't there, do 3.1 below before continuing)
   Move it into vimLab dir:           mv vimTutorial.txt cps393/labs/vimLab/
   Verify it moved there:             ls cps393/labs/vimLab/

   Move into the u1Lab directory in the course account:
                                   cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/u1Lab
                                   pwd
                                   ls
   Move into your own u1Lab dir:   cd ~/cps393/labs/u1Lab
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Copy file myInfo.txt from the course u1Lab dir into your own u1Lab dir:
            cp /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/u1Lab/myInfo.txt .
   Verify it was copied over:      ls
   Verify your vimLab dir contains vimTutorial.txt and your u1Lab dir contains myInfo.txt 
                                   cd
                                   cd cps393/labs
                                   pwd
                                   ls vimLab
                                   ls u1Lab
   If they're not there, repeat the above.

Done 3.1. Only do this if you needed to, as per 3 above.
  In the vimLab, you were supposed to create a copy of vimTutorial.txt in your
  home directory. But if it's not there now, then either you didn't do vimLab (so go 
  and do it first before continuing on with 3 above), or you copied the file into the 
  wrong directory. Try to find it by using cd and ls to hunt around your filetree. 
  Then use mv to move it from wherever it is into your home directory. If you can't 
  locate your file, then just copy the original into your home directory first, before 
  continuing on with 3 above:
  cd
  cp /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/vimLab/vimTutorial.txt .

Done 4. Fill in myInfo.txt file:
   Move into your u1Lab dir:       cd 
                                   cd cps393
                                   cd labs/u1Lab
                                   pwd
                                   ls
   Edit myInfo.txt:                vim myInfo.txt
   NOW USE VIM TO FILL IN YOUR NAME, SID, CS LOGIN, WHERE INDICATED, LEAVING
   A SPACE AFTER EACH COLON



5. Look at the man page for the ls command:  man ls
   [DONE] Find an option of the "ls" command that lists directory contents so that color is 
   used to distinguish file types. 
   [DONE]Find an option of the "ls" command so that directory names are listed with a
   trailing / character.

   Remember: when in a man page, "space bar" goes down a page, "b" goes back up a page,
   "enter" goes down one line, "/abc" searches for the string "abc", "n" searches for the
   next occurrence of the string you searched for last, "q" quits the man page.


------------------------------------
 Part 2 
------------------------------------

[DONE] 1. Move into your cps393/labs directory 
   From within labs, do the ls command with the option you found above to list in color.
   Use output redirection (the ">" character) to capture the output of this ls command 
   into a file named u1Labq01
   cat the file. Depending on the ls option you used, you might see the colors when you 
   cat the file, or not.  

[DONE] 2. Use chmod to change some permissions on your files/dirs as follows:
   file myInfo.txt permissions rw- for user, --x for group, and --- for other.
   directory labs  permissions rwx for user, r-x for group, and --- for other.
   
3. Move into your home directory and verify you're there.

   From within your home directory, use the ls command to get a long listing for 
   myInfo.txt and labs as follows:
   Specify myInfo.txt using an ABSOLUTE path name. 
   Specify labs       using an RELATIVE path name. (hint: .. goes up a directory)
   Your command should look like the following (with ### replaced appropriately)":
   ls -ld ######myInfo.txt ######labs
   Use the mouse to copy and paste the actual ls command you used into file u1Labq03:
   If you're using putty, copy-paste like this:
      -"select" whole ls command with the mouse so it's highlighted (this is putty's 
       "copy") 
      -vim u1Labq03
      -open a new line: o
      -right-click mouse (this is putty's "paste" )
      -press escape a couple of times
      -:wq to save and exit
   If you are not using Putty, then do the above, except copy-paste as usual 
   (typically by selecting from a context-menu).


4. Use output redirection (the ">") to capture the OUTPUT from your ls command from
   question 3, and save it into file u1Labq04


5. In your home directory, create a directory named Inv, and inside Inv create a file 
   named F.  What are the minimum owner (your) permissions on Inv and F that allow you
   to display the contents of F, AND allow you to see F in a listing of Inv. i.e.,
   "ls Inv" lists F and "cat Inv/F" displays contents of F. Answer in u1Labq05

6. Give a sequence of commands that will help you determine if the first 3 lines of
   file F are identical to the last 3 lines of file L. Use head, tail, diff.
   Answer in u1Labq06
