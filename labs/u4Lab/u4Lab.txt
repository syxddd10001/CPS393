-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLES:

In the following questions, unless the question states otherwise,
assume correct input (type and number of arguments, etc. )

PROGRAM NAMES:

Name your shell programs as usual: u4Labqx.sh where x is the 2-digit question number.  
e.g., u4Labq02.sh for question 2.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Write a bash function named casefold which is similar to Python's.
   It prints its input string with all the uppercase letters changed
   to lowercase. The input string is $1; remaining arguments are ignored.
   There are many solutions. One uses echo, tr and pipes.  e.g.,
   > casefold "aBc    DEFhgi  j88Kl-m    Z"
   abc    defhgi  j88kl-m    z
   > casefold "aBcD       87    3   -&@PP "
   abcd     87    3 -&@pp 
   >

2. Write a bash function named capitalize which is similar to Python's.
   It prints its input string with the first character changed to uppercase 
   and the remaining characters to lowercase. Non-alphas are unchanged. 
   If the first character is not a lowercase letter, it is unchanged. 
   The input string is as for casefold above. 
   Your function MUST USE casefold appropriately. There are many solutions. 
   One uses pipes and sed. e.g.,
   > capitalize "hI thERE 88evEryon2E"
   Hi there 88everyon2e
   > capitalize "8I   T   Here"
   8i t   here
   >

3. Write a bash function named title which is similar to Python's.
   It prints its input string with the first letter after any non-alpha 
   character changed to uppercase and remaining letters changed to lowercase. 
   The input string is as for casefold above.
   Your function MUST USE capitalize and/or casefold appropriately. 
   There are many solutions.  One uses pipes and sed. e.g.,
   > title " thIS is a TiTle   Example"
    This Is A Title   Example
   > title "hi the 2nd b3b3b3 and 3g3g3g"
   Hi The 2Nd B3B3B3 And 3G3G3G
   >

4. Shell program testfiles/u4Labq04 uses the source command to bring each 
   function within its scope, and then tests functions with various inputs. 
   The inputs are given in file data.csv
   Copy u4Labq04 and data.csv into the same directory as your solution files 
   and run it.  Output should be as follows:
casefold aBc    DEFhgi  j88Kl-m    Z
         abc    defhgi  j88kl-m    z
casefold aBcD       87    3   -&@PP
         abcd       87    3   -&@pp
capitalize hI thERE 88evEryon2E
           Hi there 88everyon2e
capitalize 8I   T   Here
           8i   t   here
title  thIS is a TiTle   Example
       This Is A Title   Example
title hi the 2nd b3b3b3 and 3g3g3g
      Hi The 2Nd B3B3B3 And 3G3G3G
