EXAMPLES:

In the following questions, unless the question states otherwise,
assume correct input (type and number of arguments, etc. )

PROGRAM NAMES:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Write an awk program named u6Labq01.awk that will count the number of blank 
   lines in its given input file, and print the message: 
   Input file F has B blank lines out of L total lines
   where F is the input file name, B is the number of blank lines found,
   and L is the total number of lines in F.
   You can use awk's defined variables to get filename, etc.
   Assume program is always run with a readable filename, as in
   > awk -f u6Labq01.awk blanks4
   Input file blanks4 has 4 blank lines out of 9 total lines
   > awk -f u6Labq01.awk empty
   Input file empty has 0 blank lines out of 0 total lines
   >

2. Write a shell program named u6Labq02.sh that uses awk to print each line
   of input on a single line, separated by ', '.
   > cat u6Labq02.infile
   this is line 1
   line 2 here
   this is the    3rd line
   4th line
   > u6Labq02.sh
   this is line 1, line 2 here, this is the    3rd line, 4th line
   >
   
3. Write a shell program named u6Labq03.sh that uses awk to normalize
   a program of temperature readings found in a tab-delimited csv file
   such as testfiles/u6Labq03infile.csv
   Program should output all temperatures in Celsius. Use the conversion
   formula: C = (F-32)/1.8
   It is OK if you use print (and your newly calculated Celsius values
   print with 4 decimal places). e.g.,
   > u6Labq03.sh u6Labq03infile.csv
   temp    unit
   26.1    C
   25.6111 C
   23.1    C
   25.7    C
   24.6111 C
   25.1667 C
   24.2    C
   26.2778 C
   27.9    C
   23.9444 C
   25.9    C
   26.1111 C
   > 
   Note: An alternate solution is also given which uses printf so that
   all temps are output with only one decimal place.
   Note1: Another alternate solution is also given which uses an awk
   if-statement instead of plain patterns. The homework for u6 outlined
   if-statements.
