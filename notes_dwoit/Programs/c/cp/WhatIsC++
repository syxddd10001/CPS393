C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Labs.
Initially named "C with Classes" (1979.)
Renamed to C++ (1983.)

Bjarne wanted to add these to C so that programs could be 
efficient (C) yet also elegant:
  -better type checking, 
  -data abstraction, 
  -object-oriented programming

The above is from Bjarne Stroustrup's FAQ:

C++ programs named:  *.cpp
Compile:             g++ program.cpp
Creates:             a.out  (override with -o flag)

g++ can compile most of our C programs too, e.g., 
g++ /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/Programs/c/c4/list.c
g++ /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/Programs/c/c2/printword.c
