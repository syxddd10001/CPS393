Course notes for Linux/Unix and C will appear in this directory.

u?.txt  -Linux/Unix notes (? stands for an integer)
c?.txt  -C notes          (? stands for an integer)

Notes are usually updated during the course, so if you make 
a copy of them, your copy will likely become outdated as
the course progresses. Check for differences between your copy 
and this copy frequently (use the Linux diff command)

These notes are for cps393 students only. Anyone not a cps393
student has no permission to do anything to/with these notes.
They cannot be copied, viewed, etc.

As a cps393 student you have permission to copy the notes and use 
them yourself, but you do not have permission to make them 
available to anyone else (personally nor publicly).

Once you are no longer  a cps393 student, you may retain a copy for 
your personal use only and may not make them available to anyone 
else (personally nor publicly).
